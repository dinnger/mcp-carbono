 * Single source of truth for where Puppeteer's browser binary lives.

 * scripts/install-browser.mjs (download time), so the install location and the
 * runtime lookup can never drift apart.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *  1. PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR env var (set this in your systemd unit for a shared
 *     path like /var/lib/mcp-carbono/.puppeteer-cache).
 *  2. A project-local .puppeteer-cache dir — stable regardless of $HOME, which
 *     is the usual failure mode for systemd services using the default
 *     ~/.cache/puppeteer.
